## üß© Getting Started

These instructions will help you make use of the Postman collection locally, run requests, and extend or integrate the APIs.

### Prerequisites

- You should have [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) installed.
- Basic familiarity with making HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) is helpful.

### Importing the Collection into Postman

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Postman.
3. Click **Import** ‚Üí choose the `NBA APIs.postman_collection.json` file.
4. The collection will appear in your workspace, with folders and individual requests.

### Exploring the Endpoints

Once imported, the Postman collection defines one or more NBA‚Äëthemed API endpoints. Each request typically has:

- **Method** (GET, POST, etc.)
- **URL / Path Parameters**
- **Query Parameters / Body** (if applicable)
- **Headers** (like `Content-Type`, `Authorization`)
- **Example responses** or tests (if configured)

You can send a request, inspect the response, and even use environment variables or tests within Postman to automate workflows.

## üõ† Usage & Customization

- **Add new endpoints**: You can expand the collection by creating new requests, grouped by functionality (e.g. ‚ÄúTeams‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlayers‚Äù, ‚ÄúGames‚Äù).
- **Use environment variables**: For base URLs, API keys, or versioning, you can define environments (e.g. `dev`, `prod`) in Postman.
- **Write tests / assertions**: Postman allows you to include tests to validate responses (status codes, JSON schema, response fields).
- **Generate code snippets**: Postman supports exporting requests as code snippets in many languages (JavaScript, Python, cURL, etc.).
